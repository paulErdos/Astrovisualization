UI Development Notes
===========================================================================

This is an unsorted list of stuff I found while playing with the program.


The VisLab Computer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Need libstdc++.so.6(GLIBCXX_3.4.15)(64Bbit)
* Need to get a mechanical keyboard 
* Need to get a mouse that doen't accumulate frictioney crud
* Might be good to get a book on general CentOS
* Need to install Flash to use GitHub --> see item 1
* Need to install Chrome to escape from FireFox --> see item 1
* I need to be using CentOS at home to bring myself up to speed on it. 


General Program Use
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* There needs to be a quit option in the GUI
* Gui controls? Sliders, etc? A small UI element could open and close a 
  panel


Navigation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Autorotation absolutely must die, incl. 'r', 'R' to speed and slow.
  --> The entire feature must be removed.

* Mouse click-drag cube rotation is completely nonfunctional
  --> The entire feature must be removed. 
  --> Replace with mouse for direction and wasd/dpad for mov't
  --> Perhaps the delta_s for mov't could be adjusted

* How do you zoom?
  --> Doesn't matter. Feature will be eliminated. 

* This is probably good for now. Other authors will give other current 
  UI specs, and implementing flying around will make a good sprint 1 
  task. Other ideas should be gathered in the backlog.
